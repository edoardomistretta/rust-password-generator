# Password Generator in Rust
Pretty simple exercise to get started with Rust.

This project provides a (pseudo) random password.

### Try
You can try to run `password-generator` with
```bash
cargo run
```
### Install
You can install and run on your machine `password-generator` with
```bash
cargo install --path .
password-generator [PWD_LENGTH]
```
### Change password length
Default password length is 24. You can edit this configuration with optional `PWD_LENGTH` argument
```bash
password-generator 12
```
